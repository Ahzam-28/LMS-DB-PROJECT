## 6. ER DIAGRAM

```
CustomUser (User Registration)
├── Student (One-to-One with CustomUser)
└── Teacher (One-to-One with CustomUser)

Category (Course Categories)
└── Course (One-to-Many)
    ├── Enrollment (One-to-Many) → Student
    ├── Payment (One-to-Many)
    ├── LessonCategory (One-to-Many)
    │   └── Lesson (One-to-Many)
    │       └── LessonFile (One-to-Many)
    └── Quiz (One-to-Many)
        ├── Question (One-to-Many)
        │   └── Answer (One-to-Many)
        └── Result (One-to-Many) → Student

OTP (For Payment Verification)
```

**Key Relationships:**
- CustomUser → Student (1:1)
- CustomUser → Teacher (1:1)
- Teacher → Course (1:Many)
- Course → Enrollment (1:Many)
- Course → Quiz (1:Many)
- Student → Enrollment (1:Many)
- Lesson → LessonFile (1:Many)
- Quiz → Question (1:Many)
- Question → Answer (1:Many)

## 7. NORMALIZED SCHEMA

The database follows **Third Normal Form (3NF)** with 15 normalized tables:

**Tables:**
1. `CustomUser` - User authentication and basic info
2. `Student` - Student profile data
3. `Teacher` - Teacher profile data
4. `Category` - Course categories
5. `Course` - Course information and details
6. `LessonCategory` - Organization of lessons within courses
7. `Lesson` - Individual lesson content
8. `LessonFile` - Attachments to lessons
9. `Enrollment` - Student course enrollments
10. `Quiz` - Course quizzes
11. `Question` - Quiz questions
12. `Answer` - Answer options for questions
13. `Result` - Student quiz results and scores
14. `Payment` - Course payment records
15. `OTP` - One-time passwords for verification

**Normalization Benefits:**
- Eliminates data redundancy
- Ensures data consistency and integrity
- Enables efficient queries through proper indexing
- Supports scalability and maintainability
